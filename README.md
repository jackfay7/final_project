# final_project
This respository holds my work on a ShinyApp built for comparing FIFA career mode player statistics from 2015-2023. The document `FinalProjectOfficial.html` is a written report which provides static examples and analysis from the ShinyApp vizualizations. The document also contains a data description, goals for the project, and plans for future work. The link in the About section brings users to a temporarily public version of the Shiny application.
